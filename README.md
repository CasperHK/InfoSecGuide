This project is developed using **Docusaurus**, a modern static site generator built with React. It enables fast, client-side navigation and offers a powerful platform to create structured, easy-to-maintain documentation websites. Docusaurus provides a great developer experience with features like hot reloading, markdown (MDX) support for interactive content, built-in versioning, and easy deployment to services like GitHub Pages. It also emphasizes accessibility, SEO friendliness, and internationalization capabilities, making it ideal for building comprehensive guideline or documentation sites with a rich user experience. This framework allows customization through React components while offering a solid default template for quick project setup and growth.
